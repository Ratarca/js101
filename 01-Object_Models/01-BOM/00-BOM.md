/ Browser Object Model (BOM)
The Browser Object Model is not standardized by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), 
so its features and behaviors may vary between different web browsers.

- Window Object (Document Object, Location, Navigation, History, Screen)
- Alerts, Prompts and confirm dialogs
- Cookies

The DOM is primarily concerned with representing and manipulating the content and structure of a web page.
The BOM deals with browser-related functionalities and provides objects and methods for managing the browser window, interacting with the user, and accessing information about the browser and device.
